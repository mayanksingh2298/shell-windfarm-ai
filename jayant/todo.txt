1. Decay EPSILON
2. Random Restarts
3. Store visual depiction when reaches local optima, and mark 400m radius ke circles on everyone
4. beech mei we can randomly send someone to another place where it doesnt cause a problem
Consider
5. combine probabilities of all 7 files

1. Numerical Optimisation Techniques, we have 100 parameters

2. another algo would find a circle of diameter 800m, and then choose one of the 50 to take this spot aisa kuch, shuffling the empty spaces, this is a new way of viewing transitions

3. In each step i could also shift the guy to the best position across the grid, dekhna padega complexity etc
