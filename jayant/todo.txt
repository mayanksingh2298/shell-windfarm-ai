1. Decay EPSILON
2. Random Restarts
3. Store visual depiction when reaches local optima, and mark 400m radius ke circles on everyone
4. beech mei we can randomly send someone to another place where it doesnt cause a problem
Consider
5. combine probabilities of all 7 files

1. Numerical Optimisation Techniques, we have 100 parameters

2. another algo would find a circle of diameter 800m, and then choose one of the 50 to take this spot aisa kuch, shuffling the empty spaces, this is a new way of viewing transitions

3. In each step i could also shift the guy to the best position across the grid, dekhna padega complexity etc

4. possibly optimise some other function and evaluate based on the given one

5. initialise with points stuck to the periphery

6. play around with some fixed configurations

7. profile code to find bottlenecks

8. consider the primary wind directionand optimise according to agar sirf voh hot

new optimisation functions, keep dist of all turbs along the perp to the primary direction exaclty 400, isko badhane se zyada fayda nhi hai, jitna along the dir badhane se?

instead of their non continuous non diff func, acc to your understanding define a similar convex differentiable loss
jisko hum optimise kar payen, and it may give a good soln

instead of optimising the power, optimise loss in velocity, treat directions as unit vectors and build an expression aise, this would work pakka
