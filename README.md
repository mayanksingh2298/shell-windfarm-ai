# shell-windfarm-ai
Optimizing the layout of a wind farm is an interesting and complex optimization problem. The key challenge arises due to the high dimensionality, complex multimodality and discontinuous nature of the search space. Hence, optimizing the layout analytically is impossible. A smarter approach towards solving this problem is through optimization strategies and computer algorithms.
